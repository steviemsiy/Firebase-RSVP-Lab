# Firebase-RSVP-Lab

In this lab we created an application that allows users to create an account with an email and password and then RSVP for an event. It also allowed the users to leave comments and included a counter of how many accounts have acknowledged that they are going. For the authentication and guest book database, we used Firebase, and a screenshot of the security rules that we wrote is included in the repository.
